Resampler is a resampling program that resamples any supported file at the desired ratio using the desired interpolation algorithm.

Currently supported files types are:
- CSV: reads the first column, ignoring the first row (headers are often in the first row)

Currently supported interpolation algorithms include:
- Piecewise constant
- Lerp
- Hermite (with tangent components)
- Catmull-Rom
